Linus on kernel management style <br>
[Posted October 6, 2004 by corbet]<br><br>

Linux kernel management style<br><br>

This is a short document describing the preferred (or made up, depending<br>
on who you ask) management style for the linux kernel.  It's meant to<br>
mirror the CodingStyle document to some degree, and mainly written to<br>
avoid answering (*) the same (or similar) questions over and over again. <br><br>

Management style is very personal and much harder to quantify than<br>
simple coding style rules, so this document may or may not have anything<br>
to do with reality.  It started as a lark, but that doesn't mean that it<br>
might not actually be true. You'll have to decide for yourself.<br><br>

Btw, when talking about "kernel manager", it's all about the technical<br>
lead persons, not the people who do traditional management inside<br>
companies.  If you sign purchase orders or you have any clue about the<br>
budget of your group, you're almost certainly not a kernel manager. <br>
These suggestions may or may not apply to you. <br><br>

First off, I'd suggest buying "Seven Habits of Highly Successful<br>
People", and NOT read it.  Burn it, it's a great symbolic gesture. <br><br>

(*) This document does so not so much by answering the question, but by<br>
making it painfully obvious to the questioner that we don't have a clue<br>
to what the answer is. <br><br>

Anyway, here goes:<br><br><br>


Chapter 1: Decisions<br><br>

Everybody thinks managers make decisions, and that decision-making is<br>
important.  The bigger and more painful the decision, the bigger the<br>
manager must be to make it.  That's very deep and obvious, but it's not<br>
actually true. <br><br>

The name of the game is to _avoid_ having to make a decision.  In<br>
particular, if somebody tells you "choose (a) or (b), we really need you<br>
to decide on this", you're in trouble as a manager.  The people you<br>
manage had better know the details better than you, so if they come to<br>
you for a technical decision, you're screwed.  You're clearly not<br>
competent to make that decision for them. <br><br>

(Corollary:if the people you manage don't know the details better than<br>
you, you're also screwed, although for a totally different reason. <br>
Namely that you are in the wrong job, and that _they_ should be managing<br>
your brilliance instead). <br><br>

So the name of the game is to _avoid_ decisions, at least the big and<br>
painful ones.  Making small and non-consequential decisions is fine, and<br>
makes you look like you know what you're doing, so what a kernel manager<br>
needs to do is to turn the big and painful ones into small things where<br>
nobody really cares. <br><br>

It helps to realize that the key difference between a big decision and a<br>
small one is whether you can fix your decision afterwards.  Any decision<br>
can be made small by just always making sure that if you were wrong (and<br>
you _will_ be wrong), you can always undo the damage later by<br>
backtracking.  Suddenly, you get to be doubly managerial for making<br>
_two_ inconsequential decisions - the wrong one _and_ the right one. <br><br>

And people will even see that as true leadership (*cough* bullshit<br>
*cough*).<br><br>

Thus the key to avoiding big decisions becomes to just avoiding to do<br>
things that can't be undone.  Don't get ushered into a corner from which<br>
you cannot escape.  A cornered rat may be dangerous - a cornered manager<br>
is just pitiful. <br><br>

It turns out that since nobody would be stupid enough to ever really let<br>
a kernel manager have huge fiscal responsibility _anyway_, it's usually<br>
fairly easy to backtrack.  Since you're not going to be able to waste<br>
huge amounts of money that you might not be able to repay, the only<br>
thing you can backtrack on is a technical decision, and there<br>
back-tracking is very easy: just tell everybody that you were an<br>
incompetent nincompoop, say you're sorry, and undo all the worthless<br>
work you had people work on for the last year.  Suddenly the decision<br>
you made a year ago wasn't a big decision after all, since it could be<br>
easily undone. <br><br>

It turns out that some people have trouble with this approach, for two<br>
reasons:<br>
 - admitting you were an idiot is harder than it looks.  We all like to<br>
   maintain appearances, and coming out in public to say that you were<br>
   wrong is sometimes very hard indeed. <br>
 - having somebody tell you that what you worked on for the last year<br>
   wasn't worthwhile after all can be hard on the poor lowly engineers<br>
   too, and while the actual _work_ was easy enough to undo by just<br>
   deleting it, you may have irrevocably lost the trust of that<br>
   engineer.  And remember: "irrevocable" was what we tried to avoid in<br>
   the first place, and your decision ended up being a big one after<br>
   all. <br><br>

Happily, both of these reasons can be mitigated effectively by just<br>
admitting up-front that you don't have a friggin' clue, and telling<br>
people ahead of the fact that your decision is purely preliminary, and<br>
might be the wrong thing.  You should always reserve the right to change<br>
your mind, and make people very _aware_ of that.  And it's much easier<br>
to admit that you are stupid when you haven't _yet_ done the really<br>
stupid thing.<br><br>

Then, when it really does turn out to be stupid, people just roll their<br>
eyes and say "Oops, he did it again".  <br><br>

This preemptive admission of incompetence might also make the people who<br>
actually do the work also think twice about whether it's worth doing or<br>
not.  After all, if _they_ aren't certain whether it's a good idea, you<br>
sure as hell shouldn't encourage them by promising them that what they<br>
work on will be included.  Make them at least think twice before they<br>
embark on a big endeavor. <br><br>

Remember: they'd better know more about the details than you do, and<br>
they usually already think they have the answer to everything.  The best<br>
thing you can do as a manager is not to instill confidence, but rather a<br>
healthy dose of critical thinking on what they do. <br><br>

Btw, another way to avoid a decision is to plaintively just whine "can't<br>
we just do both?" and look pitiful.  Trust me, it works.  If it's not<br>
clear which approach is better, they'll eventually figure it out.  The<br>
answer may end up being that both teams get so frustrated by the<br>
situation that they just give up. <br><br>

That may sound like a failure, but it's usually a sign that there was<br>
something wrong with both projects, and the reason the people involved<br>
couldn't decide was that they were both wrong.  You end up coming up<br>
smelling like roses, and you avoided yet another decision that you could<br>
have screwed up on. <br><br><br>


Chapter 2: People<br><br>

Most people are idiots, and being a manager means you'll have to deal<br>
with it, and perhaps more importantly, that _they_ have to deal with<br>
_you_. <br><br>

It turns out that while it's easy to undo technical mistakes, it's not<br>
as easy to undo personality disorders.  You just have to live with<br>
theirs - and yours. <br><br>

However, in order to prepare yourself as a kernel manager, it's best to<br>
remember not to burn any bridges, bomb any innocent villagers, or<br>
alienate too many kernel developers. It turns out that alienating people<br>
is fairly easy, and un-alienating them is hard. Thus "alienating"<br>
immediately falls under the heading of "not reversible", and becomes a<br>
no-no according to Chapter 1.<br><br>

There's just a few simple rules here:<br>
 (1) don't call people d*ckheads (at least not in public)<br>
 (2) learn how to apologize when you forgot rule (1)<br><br>

The problem with #1 is that it's very easy to do, since you can say<br>
"you're a d*ckhead" in millions of different ways (*), sometimes without<br>
even realizing it, and almost always with a white-hot conviction that<br>
you are right. <br><br>

And the more convinced you are that you are right (and let's face it,<br>
you can call just about _anybody_ a d*ckhead, and you often _will_ be<br>
right), the harder it ends up being to apologize afterwards. <br><br>

To solve this problem, you really only have two options:<br>
 - get really good at apologies<br>
 - spread the "love" out so evenly that nobody really ends up feeling<br>
   like they get unfairly targeted.  Make it inventive enough, and they<br>
   might even be amused. <br><br>

The option of being unfailingly polite really doesn't exist. Nobody will<br>
trust somebody who is so clearly hiding his true character.<br><br>

(*) Paul Simon sang "Fifty Ways to Lose Your Lover", because quite<br>
frankly, "A Million Ways to Tell a Developer He Is a D*ckhead" doesn't<br>
scan nearly as well.  But I'm sure he thought about it. <br><br><br>


Chapter 3: People II - the Good Kind<br><br>

While it turns out that most people are idiots, the corollary to that is<br>
sadly that you are one too, and that while we can all bask in the secure<br>
knowledge that we're better than the average person (let's face it,<br>
nobody ever believes that they're average or below-average), we should<br>
also admit that we're not the sharpest knife around, and there will be<br>
other people that are less of an idiot that you are. <br><br>

Some people react badly to smart people.  Others take advantage of them. <br><br>

Make sure that you, as a kernel maintainer, are in the second group. <br>
Suck up to them, because they are the people who will make your job<br>
easier. In particular, they'll be able to make your decisions for you,<br>
which is what the game is all about.<br><br>

So when you find somebody smarter than you are, just coast along.  Your<br>
management responsibilities largely become ones of saying "Sounds like a<br>
good idea - go wild", or "That sounds good, but what about xxx?".  The<br>
second version in particular is a great way to either learn something<br>
new about "xxx" or seem _extra_ managerial by pointing out something the<br>
smarter person hadn't thought about.  In either case, you win.<br><br>

One thing to look out for is to realize that greatness in one area does<br>
not necessarily translate to other areas.  So you might prod people in<br>
specific directions, but let's face it, they might be good at what they<br>
do, and suck at everything else.  The good news is that people tend to<br>
naturally gravitate back to what they are good at, so it's not like you<br>
are doing something irreversible when you _do_ prod them in some<br>
direction, just don't push too hard.<br><br><br>


		Chapter 4: Placing blame<br><br>

Things will go wrong, and people want somebody to blame. Tag, you're it.<br><br>

It's not actually that hard to accept the blame, especially if people<br>
kind of realize that it wasn't _all_ your fault.  Which brings us to the<br>
best way of taking the blame: do it for another guy. You'll feel good<br>
for taking the fall, he'll feel good about not getting blamed, and the<br>
guy who lost his whole 36GB porn-collection because of your incompetence<br>
will grudgingly admit that you at least didn't try to weasel out of it.<br><br>

Then make the developer who really screwed up (if you can find him) know<br>
_in_private_ that he screwed up.  Not just so he can avoid it in the<br>
future, but so that he knows he owes you one.  And, perhaps even more<br>
importantly, he's also likely the person who can fix it.  Because, let's<br>
face it, it sure ain't you. <br><br>

Taking the blame is also why you get to be manager in the first place. <br>
It's part of what makes people trust you, and allow you the potential<br>
glory, because you're the one who gets to say "I screwed up".  And if<br>
you've followed the previous rules, you'll be pretty good at saying that<br>
by now. <br><br><br>


		Chapter 5: Things to avoid<br><br>

There's one thing people hate even more than being called "d*ckhead",<br>
and that is being called a "d*ckhead" in a sanctimonious voice.  The<br>
first you can apologize for, the second one you won't really get the<br>
chance.  They likely will no longer be listening even if you otherwise<br>
do a good job. <br><br>

We all think we're better than anybody else, which means that when<br>
somebody else puts on airs, it _really_ rubs us the wrong way.  You may<br>
be morally and intellectually superior to everybody around you, but<br>
don't try to make it too obvious unless you really _intend_ to irritate<br>
somebody (*). <br><br>

Similarly, don't be too polite or subtle about things. Politeness easily<br>
ends up going overboard and hiding the problem, and as they say, "On the<br>
internet, nobody can hear you being subtle". Use a big blunt object to<br>
hammer the point in, because you can't really depend on people getting<br>
your point otherwise.<br><br>

Some humor can help pad both the bluntness and the moralizing.  Going<br>
overboard to the point of being ridiculous can drive a point home<br>
without making it painful to the recipient, who just thinks you're being<br>
silly.  It can thus help get through the personal mental block we all<br>
have about criticism. <br><br>

(*) Hint: internet newsgroups that are not directly related to your work<br>
are great ways to take out your frustrations at other people. Write<br>
insulting posts with a sneer just to get into a good flame every once in<br>
a while, and you'll feel cleansed. Just don't crap too close to home.<br><br><br>


		Chapter 6: Why me?<br><br>

Since your main responsibility seems to be to take the blame for other<br>
peoples mistakes, and make it painfully obvious to everybody else that<br>
you're incompetent, the obvious question becomes one of why do it in the<br>
first place?<br><br>

First off, while you may or may not get screaming teenage girls (or<br>
boys, let's not be judgmental or sexist here) knocking on your dressing<br>
room door, you _will_ get an immense feeling of personal accomplishment<br>
for being "in charge".  Never mind the fact that you're really leading<br>
by trying to keep up with everybody else and running after them as fast<br>
as you can.  Everybody will still think you're the person in charge. <br><br>

It's a great job if you can hack it.<br><br>
